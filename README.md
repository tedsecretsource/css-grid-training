### Contribution guidelines ###

* Have fun
* You can use any pure CSS technique + HTML so long as old school does not use Flex and Flex does not use Grid
* Use of HTML for layout is precisely the kind of thing we are trying to avoid as it adds KB to the source and makes it brittle. Keep that in mind.
